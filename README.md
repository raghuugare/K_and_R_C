My explorations &amp; exercises as I went through the classic **[The C Programming Language](http://www.amazon.com/C-Programming-Language-2nd-Edition/dp/0131103628)** by [Brian Kernighan][brian_kernighan] &amp; [Dennis Ritchie][dennis_ritchie]. 

Hope this encourages my fellow developer-friends also to 'dive into' (the) [**C**][c_wiki] ! :)
